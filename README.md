- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dave, an IT Technician with eServices Wolverhampton.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using technology to aid in teaching and learning.
- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently reading Broken Code by Jeff Horwitz.

I am now at the stage where I can update Github Repos from VS Code. Minor for some, major for me.
